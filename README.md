**Smart Financial Management System**

**Project Title:**

**Smart Financial Management System**


I developed this automated financial management system for SecureBank using Python and ipywidgets as part of my Programming for Finance course. The system is designed to help users with various financial operations through an interactive interface. It includes the following features:

**Loan Eligibility & Interest Rate Calculation:** Evaluates loan eligibility based on employment status, income, and credit score.
**Investment Risk Assessment:** Classifies investment portfolios based on stock returns.
**Loan Repayment Tracker:** Tracks loan repayment progress and displays the remaining balance after each installment.
**Stock Price Monitoring and Trading Strategy:** Monitors stock prices and triggers alerts when a target price is reached.
**Currency Exchange Rate Tracker:** Tracks currency exchange rates and suggests conversions when the target rate is achieved.
This project breaks down each requirement into logical steps, implementing them using ipywidgets for a smooth and interactive user experience.
